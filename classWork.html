        <p> Mr Jerry Duncan told me to do this classwork, he is my coach in programming and he is doing his very best to make sure i know this in three months.i am so appreciative man and this i wont ever forget.This is actually my first classwork and i am so so happy i am doing it right and i know he will be so pleased when he sees this when i send it to github.Thanks bro,i am grateful.</p>
        <p> On this special day,i dedicate my life and everything into this program and i am so determined to learn this effectively because i want to create a positive impact in my society and world at large.At the end of this program i want to be able to profer solutions to everyone who need my service and moreso give glory to God.Thank you Mr Jerry Duncan for helping to make this dream soon become a reality.</p>
